**POST** `/api/tasks`

```json
{
  "taskName": "Sample Task",

  "assignedUser": "John Doe",
  "dueDate": "2025-12-31",

## Database Schema

### Table: `task`

| Column        | Type    | Constraints                      |
|---------------|---------|----------------------------------|
| id            | BIGINT  | PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT      |
| task_name     | VARCHAR | NOT NULL                         |
| description   | VARCHAR |                                  |
| assigned_user | VARCHAR |                                  |
| due_date      | DATE    |                                  |
| priority      | VARCHAR | Enum: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH          |
| status        | VARCHAR | Enum: PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, DONE |
| created_date  | DATE    | Auto-generated on first save     |

> The schema is auto-generated by Spring Data JPA from the `Task` entity at runtime. The application uses an H2 in-memory database, so all data resets on restart.

---

## Frontend UI

A lightweight UI served from the `static` resources folder allows users to:

- Create tasks via a form
- View all tasks in a table
- Retrieve a task by ID
- Delete tasks

The UI communicates with the backend using the **JavaScript Fetch API**.
